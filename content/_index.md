# TL:DR

I am a Cloud Engineer who is interested in infrastructure as code, search and relevancy technologies, and cloud remediation and governance. My first tech-job was support for a rural ISP in 1997, and I've continued to thrive in a changing industry, growing with it's evolution. I now work on web-scale deployments to keep them up, secure, and well-architected. My non-tech hobbies include travel, photography, and table-top gaming.
