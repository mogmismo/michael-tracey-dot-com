I am a Cloud Engineer who is interested in infrastructure as code, Search technologies, and cloud remediation and governance. 

My first tech-job was support for a rural ISP in 1997, and I've continued to thrive in a changing industry, growing with it's evolution.  I've done network administration and unix system administration over the years, and even built datacenters. I've spent time in E-Commerce, and enjoyed the chance to manage product catalogs with over 100 million products.

Now I'm primarily working on Infrasturcture as Code, managing core resources for a large learning platform, at web-scale.

 My non-tech hobbies include travel, photography, and table-top gaming.
